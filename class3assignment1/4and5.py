# try:
#     print(x)
# except:
#     print("uh oh")

# 4. Using the except clause above we can catch all exception types
# It is a generic exception that will catch any exception that might occur.

# 5. The downside of using this kind of exception "handling" is that we won't be able
# to customize certain behaviour for specific exception types.
# This is especially important when we have multiple "potential" pit falls in a block of code.
